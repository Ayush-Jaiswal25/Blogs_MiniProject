# Blogs_MiniProject
This mini project combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js to create a dynamic and user-friendly Blog creation application. This project allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks in a visually appealing and responsive interface.
This mini project gave me an excellent opportunity to practice and showcase your skills in front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end development (Node.js). It allows users to interact by performing real time work like creating new blogs or editing the existing blogs, making it a practical and engaging learning experience.
